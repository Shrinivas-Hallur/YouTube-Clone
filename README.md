## **YouTube Clone - Frontend Only**  

### **Overview**  
This is a simple **frontend-only** YouTube clone built with **HTML & CSS**. It recreates the **homepage, and navigation bar**, focusing purely on layout and design. There’s no backend, so features like uploads and user accounts aren’t included—just a clean, responsive interface.  

### **Features**  
✅ **Responsive Design** – Works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and phones.  
✅ **Navigation Bar** – Includes a logo, search bar, and profile icon.  
✅ **Sidebar Menu** – Quick access to Home, Trending, Subscriptions, and more.  
✅ **Video Grid Layout** – Displays video thumbnails, titles, and channel info.   
✅ **Hover & Click Effects** – Adds a polished, interactive feel.  

### **Tech Stack**  
- **HTML5** – For structure.  
- **CSS3** – For styling (using Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries).  

### **Why Build This?**  
- Sharpen **frontend skills**.  
- Learn **UI/UX design best practices**.  
- Get hands-on with **responsive web design**.  

Further, I'm looking to implement its **backend** by learning technologies like **JavaScript, Node.js, databases, and authentication** to make it a **fully functional** web app.
